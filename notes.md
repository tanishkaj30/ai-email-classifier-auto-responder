# Project Notes

## Project Status
This project was fully functional during development.

It stopped running because the OpenAI API billing expired and I no longer had access to the API key.

## Reason for Missing Live Demo
- OpenAI API requires billing to generate responses
- Without an active billing account, the workflow cannot be executed
- For security reasons, API keys were not committed to GitHub

## What I Learned
- Designing AI-driven automation workflows using n8n
- Prompt engineering for email classification
- Integrating Gmail API with AI models
- Handling API limitations and failures gracefully
- Writing clean documentation for real-world projects

## Future Improvements
- Replace OpenAI with an open-source LLM
- Add retry & fallback logic
- Deploy using Docker for easier setup
